```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      eval = TRUE,
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE)
```

# Overview

In this exercise.

# Getting Started
```{r echo=FALSE}
packages = c('ggiraph', 'plotly', 
             'DT', 'patchwork',
             'gganimate', 'tidyverse',
             'readxl', 'gifski', 'gapminder',
             'treemap', 'treemapify',
             'rPackedBar')

for (p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p,character.only = T)
}
```

# Importing Data
The code chuck below import *Exam_data.csv* from the data folder into R by using [`read_csv()`](www.test.com) of [**readr**](www.test1.com) package and save it as an tibble data frame called *GDP* and *WorldCountry*. 

```{r}
GDP <- read_csv("data/GDP.csv")
WorldCountry <- read_csv("data/WorldCountry.csv")

```

# Data preparetion

mutate() of dplyr package is used to convert all values in the 2020 field into numeric data type.usually used to compute. 
select() of dplyr package is used to extract column 1 to 3 and Values field.
pivot_wider() of tidyr package is used to split the values in Series Name field into columns.
left_join() of dplyr package is used to perform a left-join by using Country Code of GDP_selected and ISO-alpha3 Code of WorldCountry tibble data tables as unique identifier.

```{r}

GDP_selected <- GDP %>%
  mutate(Values = as.numeric(`2020`)) %>% #take note of the `2020` it is not '2020'  (the bracket)
  select(1:3, Values) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = `Series Name`,
              values_from = `Values`) %>%
  left_join(y=WorldCountry, by = c("Country Code" = "ISO-alpha3 Code"))
```


```{r}
treemap(GDP_selected,
        index=c("Continent", "Country Name"),
        vSize="GDP (current US$)",
        vColor="GDP per capita (current US$)",
        type = "value",
        algorithm = "squarified",
        title="GDP (current US$) , 2020",
        title.legend = "GDP per capita (current US$)"
        )
```

```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("timelyportfolio/d3treeR")
```

```{r}
library(d3treeR)

```

```{r}
tm <- treemap(GDP_selected,
        index=c("Continent", "Country Name"),
        vSize="GDP (current US$)",
        vColor="GDP per capita (current US$)",
        type = "value",
        algorithm = "squarified",
        title="GDP (current US$) , 2020",
        title.legend = "GDP per capita (current US$)"
        )
```


```{r}
d3tree(tm, rootname = "World" )
```
