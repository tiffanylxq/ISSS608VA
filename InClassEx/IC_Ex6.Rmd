                      eval = TRUE,

# Getting Started

## Setting up R packages

To start with, need necessary packages are launched using `library()`.

```{r}
packages = c('tidyverse', 'tmap', 'sf',
             'lubridate','clock',
             'sftime','rmarkdown')

for (p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p,character.only = T)
}
```

## Importing Data

We are using the data from the [VAST Challenge 2022](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2022/); in particular, the `School.csv` , `Pubs.csv` , `Apartments.csv` , `Employer.csv` , `Buildings.csv` and `Restaurants.csv` from the **Attributes** folder.

```{r}
schools <- read_sf("data/wkt/Schools.csv", 
                   options = "GEOM_POSSIBLE_NAMES=location")

pubs <- read_sf("data/wkt/Pubs.csv", 
                   options = "GEOM_POSSIBLE_NAMES=location")

apartments <- read_sf("data/wkt/Apartments.csv", 
                   options = "GEOM_POSSIBLE_NAMES=location")

buildings <- read_sf("data/wkt/Buildings.csv", 
                   options = "GEOM_POSSIBLE_NAMES=location")

employers <- read_sf("data/wkt/Employers.csv", 
                   options = "GEOM_POSSIBLE_NAMES=location")

restaurants <- read_sf("data/wkt/Restaurants.csv", 
                   options = "GEOM_POSSIBLE_NAMES=location")

```

## Examining the data

If we try to plot the data `Schpols`, we see that each column is treated as a venue and hence the coordinates are repeated across the 4 variables. 

```{r}
 plot(schools)

```

**print()** can be used to review the data object.

```{r}
#the coord are converted to geospatial data denoted by the "c" before the points in the dataframe; and "points/polygon" in the tibble table.
print(schools)
print(buildings)

##crs = coordinate reference system; not revealed by the ogranizer in our case
```

# Geospatial Data

Buildings

```{r}
tmap_mode("view") #on interactive
tm_shape(buildings)+
tm_polygons(col = "grey60",
           size = 1,
           border.col = "black",
           border.lwd = 1)
tmap_mode("plot") #off interactive
```

Buildings + Employers, the sequence matters! Points layered on top of polygon

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(buildings)+
tm_polygons(col = "grey60",
           size = 1,
           border.col = "black",
           border.lwd = 1) +
tm_shape(employers) +
  tm_dots(col = "red")
```

# Movement Data

```{r, eval=FALSE}
logs <- read_sf("data/wkt/ParticipantStatusLogs1.csv", 
                options = "GEOM_POSSIBLE_NAMES=currentLocation")
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
glimpse(logs)

#sf cannot understand timestamp hence it is converted to chr.

```

## Processing movement data

```{r,eval=FALSE}
logs_selected <- logs %>%
  mutate(Timestamp = date_time_parse(timestamp, 
                                     zone = "",
                                     format = "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")) %>%
  mutate(day = get_day(Timestamp)) %>%
  filter(currentMode == "Transport")
```

Dataframe`logs_selected` is saved and read in RDS format to avoid uploading large file to Git.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
 write_rds(logs_selected, "data/rds/logs_selected.rds")

```

We will load back the `logs_selected.rds` file and work on this file henceforth.

```{r}
 logs_selected <- read_rds("data/rds/logs_selected.rds")

```

## Static movement data


```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(buildings)+
tm_polygons(col = "grey60",
           size = 1,
           border.col = "black",
           border.lwd = 1) +
tm_shape(logs_selected) +
  tm_dots(col = "red") 

```

## Events Points

To count how much activities going on within the hexagons, we first create the hexagons.

```{r}
 
hex <- st_make_grid(buildings, 
                    cellsize=100, 
                    square=FALSE) %>%
  st_sf() %>%
  rowid_to_column('hex_id')
plot(hex)
```
find the event points (i.e. `logs_selected` data) within the hexagon grid, hence the obs is the same as the logs_selected. then we count how many event points happens within the hexagon. 

```{r}
points_in_hex <- st_join(logs_selected, 
                         hex, 
                         join=st_within) %>%
  st_set_geometry(NULL) %>% #geometric layer is removed hence we can fill in the count in the next step
  count(name='pointCount', hex_id)
head(points_in_hex)
```

```{r}
hex_combined <- hex %>%
  left_join(points_in_hex, 
            by = 'hex_id') %>%
  replace(is.na(.), 0)
```

```{r}
tm_shape(hex_combined %>%
           filter(pointCount > 0))+ #filter away those 0 event hexagon
  tm_fill("pointCount",
          n = 8,
          style = "quantile") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.1)
```
## Movement path from event points

```{r}
logs_path <- logs_selected %>%
  group_by(participantId, day) %>%
  summarize(m = mean(Timestamp), 
            do_union=FALSE) %>%
  st_cast("LINESTRING") #will combine all datapoint that belongs to the same person on the same date
```
